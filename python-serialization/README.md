# Python – Serialization

This project demonstrates **basic serialization and deserialization in Python**
using the **JSON format**.

Serialization is the process of converting a Python object into a format that
can be stored or transmitted (such as JSON), while deserialization is the
process of reconstructing the original Python object from that format.
